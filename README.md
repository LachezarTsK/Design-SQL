One of the methods given by for implementation by Leetcode, namely “exp(String name)” – standing for export table with the requested name (this not very descriptive name is given by Leetcode, so it cannot be changed) - requires the return of the table with rows sorted by rowIDs. This determines two possible approaches to solving the problem:<br/> - mapping the rowIDs to columns in a HashMap and sorting the rows when this method is called.<br/>
- mapping the rowIDs to columns in a SortedMap, so there would be no need to sort the rows when the method is called.


- Solutions with Sorting: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, C#, Kotlin, Go.

- Solutions with Sorted Map: Java, C++, Kotlin. As of September 2025, from the programming languages I know, only these three languages have an inbuilt Sorted Map.
